        <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by
            Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system
            programming language to write an operating system. The main features 
            of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, 
            and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system 
            programmings like an operating system or compiler development.<br>
            Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly
            from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript and many other 
            languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of 
            C language.<br><br>

            <h2>Data Type</h2>
            <p>In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data
                associated with variables.

            <h2>Condition Operator</h2>
            <p>Conditonal statements in C programming are used to make decisions based 
                on the conditions. Conditional statements execute sequentially when
                there is no condition around the statements. If you put some condition
                for a block of statements, the execution flow may change based on the
                result evaluated by the condition.
            </p>
            <p>In C programming conditional statements are possible with the help of the 
                following two construct:<br><br>1. if statement.<br><br><img src="if.png" alt="for loop" width="600px"><br><br>
                2. if-else if satement.<br><br><img src="ifelse.png" alt="for loop" width="600px">

        </div>
        <div id="loop">
            <h2>Loop</h2>
            <p>In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code 
                until the specified condition is met.<br><br>C programming  has
                three types of loops:<br>1. for loop<br><img src="forLoop.png" alt="for loop" width="600px"><br>2. while loop
                <br><img src="whileLoop.png" alt="for loop" width="600px"><br>
                3. do...while loop<br><img src="doWhile.png" alt="for loop" width="600px"><br>
                
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="function">
            <h2>Function</h2>
            <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, 
                which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
                You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among 
                different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
                A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. 
                A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
                The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. 
                For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to 
                another location, and many more functions.</p>
